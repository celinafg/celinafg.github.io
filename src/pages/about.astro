      <h2>I like making things, but I...</h2>
      <p>...don’t stick to just one thing.</p>
      <p>
        I work at the intersection of <strong>design, research, and code</strong
        >, figuring out how to break things, fix things, and make them better.
        Whether it’s <strong>frontend engineering</strong>, <strong
          >data-driven design</strong
        >, or something in between, I like to explore, experiment, and build—and
        when the right tools don’t exist, I create them.
      </p>

      <h2>A nonlinear path</h2>
      <p>
        My background isn’t a straight line—marketing → software engineering →
        human-computer interaction. After managing a web project in a marketing
        role, I decided to teach myself to code and ended up shifting my entire
        career. Since then, I’ve worked on <strong
          >frontend libraries for large systems</strong
        >, <strong>conducted UX research for public transit</strong>, and found
        ways to bring <strong>engineering, design, and data</strong> together to
        solve real problems.
      </p>

      <h2>What I work on</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Designing and building for the web</strong> – Frontend, interaction
          design, and making sure digital experiences are seamless.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Understanding users</strong> – UX research, usability testing,
          and uncovering why people behave the way they do.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Experimenting with technology</strong> – Creative tech, prototyping,
          and testing new ways to create.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Working with data</strong> – Cleaning, analyzing, and translating
          complex information into something useful.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outside of work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I 3D print <strong>over-engineered solutions</strong> to small, everyday
          problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          I take on <strong>multi-day baking projects</strong>, because good
          things take time.
        </li>
        <li>
          I research the <strong>latest e-ink tablets</strong>, even though I
          already have more than enough.
        </li>
        <li>
          I make <strong>onigiri</strong>, because I enjoy perfecting the little
          details.
        </li>
