In October 2022, Seattle's AQI plunged to an unsettling score of 168, ranking the worst in the world. Over the course of a few months, the region experienced hazardous air, disrupting everyday activities and affecting the health of residents. As fire season continues to plague the western region of the United States year after year, we felt compelled to explore the more immediate future of living in this environmental situation.

The project prompted more exploratory design solutions, but given the results of our research, we pivoted from our initial design question to "How might we inform people of the effects of poor air quality, and influence their behavior to mitigate exposure"? something that educated and informed residents that find themselves living in calamity. Our final deliverable is 3 part air quality system that the City of Seattle, focusing on a physical prototype. It consists of an Air Quality Station, an alert system, and a reimagining of visualizations used in the air quality rating.

## Research

- secondary research
- Surveys and questionnaires
- interviews

### What is hazardous air?

> The size of the particle is so small, that it can travel deeply into the respiratory tract and reach the lungs.

We chose to focus on the wildfire phenomenon, because we found our day to day affected by smoke season. We consulted the research experts have conducted on how air quality is affected by wildfires, and how it affects our health. Surprisingly, this phenomenon is quite recent, with studies only reflecting less than 10 years of results.

What makes wildfire smoke dangerous is particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), tiny particles that are 2.5 microns or less in width. The size of the particle is so small, that it can travel deeply into the respiratory tract and reach the lungs.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### Who does this affect anyway?

Everyone!
The most sensitive groups are outdoor workers, pregnant people, those with heart and lung disease, and those over the ages of 65 or under 18.

However, anyone exposed to this can experience eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Studies have shown that there may be a relationship between inhaling PM2.5 and reduced lung function and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma ad COPD. (Youssouf et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016a).

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### What do Seattle residents know about PM2.5?

Given the alarming effects of wildfire smoke, we wanted to know:

1. how are residents dealing with this problem today? What behavior or tools are they using?
2. Which groups are interested / actively taking measures to protect themselves against hazardous air (and those that prefer not to do anything?
3. Are the current official resources (epa/airnow.gov) and tiers of air quality being used by residents? How helpful are these diagrams?

We used surveys to quickly gather data on beliefs, sentiments, actions and knowledge of our Seattle-area network, which included family, friends, and co-workers. Given the short timespan of the project, we resorted to snowball sampling. The survey results were used as a basis for our semi-structured interviews.

## Findings

### The effects of wildfire smoke are misunderstood and underestimated.

Based on our research, there are differing opinions and behaviors when it came to smoke season. When it came down to how deeply they understood the risks of wildfire smoke, participants often misunderstood or grossly underestimated effects.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### People rarely followed strict rules; decisions were contextual (social events vs. personal health)

There's no general consensus when it comes to deciding to participate in activities that require consideration for air quality.

Some base their decisions on features of the api system like seeing the word "unhealthy" on the weather apps, or seeing the color of the AQI meter, or simply judging by looking outside.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### Visual cues like AQI color scales and outdoor visibility often dictated behavior

Most survey respondents reported participating in outdoor activities at least several times a week, and consider themselves to be health conscious. However, we found that education on hazardous air was not clear to them. From not knowing who to trust as a source (most check weather apps, followed by news or a friend, and government communication), to what thresholds influence whether they decide to be exposed are not are a mixed bag.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### Pivoting our design question:

Given the lack of clear official resource and the lack of knowledge residents have on AQI, we pivoted our design question from something that was a bit more speculative into something that could be implemented in the medium term.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### Rather than a persona, a mindset

[empiric] [rationalist] [impressionable]
For this project, we found that persona's were not the best way to describe residents. When probed about their mask wearing behaviors or their considerations on when they could be exposed to hazardous air, they would react to the circumstance vs. follow the strict guidelines. Most participants when describing their decision making process, shift between one or more personas, compromising to meet social demands (e.g. friends visiting) or personal goals (hiking without a mask), despite describing themselves as health conscious.

## the solution: 3-part air quality system

### imagine this...

<AudioPlayer />

Given the lack of knowledge around air quality, we chose to create a 3-part system instead of a single solution in order to increase chances of residents encountering information about air quality. We envisioned a three part system designed to deliver timely, trustworthy and actionable air quality information.

> The design should be accessible, trustworthy, have calm but firm messaging, informative, and easily understandable.

>
  1. Air Quality Stations
   Physical kiosks placed in high-traffic areas like bus stops, parks, and downtown hubs.

- Features:

  - **Visual AQI displays:** Easy-to-read, color-coded indicators for air quality levels.
  - **Mask dispensers:** Free N95 masks available via a secure, SMS-based system.
  - **Audio instructions:** Accessibility features for visually impaired users.

- **Rationale:** Many people base decisions on visual cues. By integrating these stations into their daily routines, we reinforced awareness at key decision points.

### Texts and alerts

A text-based notification service delivering real-time air quality updates and personalized alerts.

- Users can customize thresholds (e.g., notifications for AQI >100).
- Emergency alerts sent automatically when AQI exceeds 150.
- **Rationale:** Text messages ensure inclusivity, reaching people without smartphones or reliable internet access.

### Educational website

A central hub for air quality resources, including:

- Health tips for mitigating exposure.
- Scientific explanations of AQI and its impacts.
- Tools to customize SMS alerts.
- **Rationale:** Deepened engagement by empowering users to learn more at their own pace.

### prototyping and testing

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

- Built and tested three iterations of the Air Quality Station with users.
- Conducted usability tests for the SMS system and website with 6 participants.

### reworking the visualization of air quality

![reworked air quality visualizations with color palette](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1740496078/portfolio/home-assets-7_slwqhq.png)

Many participants reported using at-a-glance judgement make decisions, and this compelled us to rework the current visualization of air quality. We reduced the number of levels and improved the color scheme based on our research and usability testing. The visualizations went through user testing, and are understandable regardless of whether or not you are color blind.]

<SectionDivider type="dots" label=" " color="#0056b3" />

### Key Results

1. Increased Awareness: Over 80% of users reported learning new health risks related to air quality.
2. Behavior Change: Testing participants said they were more likely to wear masks and adjust outdoor plans based on the system’s information.
3. Positive Feedback: Users appreciated the clarity of the AQI visualization and the reliability of the SMS notifications.

### Takeaways

- Iterate with Purpose: Testing early and often helped us refine our designs to better align with user needs.
- Adaptability is Key: The pivot in our design question was a turning point, enabling us to address the root cause of behavior.
- Empathy First: Understanding the diverse needs and mindsets of our audience ensured that our solution was both inclusive and impactful.

This case study demonstrates my ability to lead user research, synthesize complex data, and translate insights into actionable, user-centered designs.
