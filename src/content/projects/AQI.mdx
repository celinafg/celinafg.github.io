title: "Designing for a future of wildfire"

excerpt: In 2023, the west coast of the United States experienced hazardous levels of air quality, leaving residents exposed to harmful air. With the regularity of wildfires in the United States, how might we co-exist and continue living as usual with our Environment?

In October 2022, Seattle's AQI plunged to an unsettling score of 168, ranking the worst in the world. Over the course of a few months, the region experienced hazardous air, disrupting everyday activities and affecting the health of residents. As fire season continues to plague the western region of the United States year after year, we felt compelled to explore the more immediate future of living in this environmental situation.

The project prompted more exploratory design solutions, but given the results of our research, we pivoted from our initial design question to "How might we inform people of the effects of poor air quality, and influence their behavior to mitigate exposure"? something that educated and informed residents that find themselves living in calamity. Our final deliverable is 3 part air quality system that the City of Seattle, focusing on a physical prototype. It consists of an Air Quality Station, an alert system, and a reimagining of visualizations used in the air quality rating.

### What is hazardous air?

> The size of the particle is so small, that it can travel deeply into the respiratory tract and reach the lungs.

We chose to focus on the wildfire phenomenon, because we found our day to day affected by smoke season. We consulted the research experts have conducted on how air quality is affected by wildfires, and how it affects our health. Surprisingly, this phenomenon is quite recent, with studies only reflecting less than 10 years of results.

What makes wildfire smoke dangerous is particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), tiny particles that are 2.5 microns or less in width. The size of the particle is so small, that it can travel deeply into the respiratory tract and reach the lungs.

### Who does this affect anyway?

Everyone!
The most sensitive groups are outdoor workers, pregnant people, those with heart and lung disease, and those over the ages of 65 or under 18.

However, anyone exposed to this can experience eye, nose, throat and lung irritation, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Studies have shown that there may be a relationship between inhaling PM2.5 and reduced lung function and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma ad COPD. (Youssouf et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016a).

### What do Seattle residents know about PM2.5?

Given the alarming effects of wildfire smoke, we wanted to know:

1. how are residents dealing with this problem today? What behavior or tools are they using?
2. Which groups are interested / actively taking measures to protect themselves against hazardous air (and those that prefer not to do anything?
3. Are the current official resources (epa/airnow.gov) and tiers of air quality being used by residents? How helpful are these diagrams?

We used surveys to quickly gather data on beliefs, sentiments, actions and knowledge of our Seattle-area network, which included family, friends, and co-workers. Given the short timespan of the project, we resorted to snowball sampling. The survey results were used as a basis for our semi-structured interviews.

## Findings

### The effects of wildfire smoke are misunderstood and underestimated.

Based on our research, there are differing opinions and behaviors when it came to smoke season. When it came down to how deeply they understood the risks of wildfire smoke, participants often misunderstood or grossly underestimated effects.

###

### There's no general consensus when it comes to deciding to participate in activities that require consideration for air quality.

Most survey respondents reported participating in outdoor activities at least several times a week, and consider themselves to be health conscious. However, we found that education on hazardous air was not clear to them. From not knowing who to trust as a source (most check weather apps, followed by news or a friend, and government communication), to what thresholds influence whether they decide to be exposed are not are a mixed bag. Some base their decisions on features of the api system like seeing the word "unhealthy" on the weather apps, or seeing the color of the AQI meter, or simply judging by looking outside.

### Picvoting our design question:

Given the lack of clear official resource and the lack of knowledge residents have on AQI, we pivoted our design question from something that was a bit more speculative into something that could be implemented in the medium term.

### Rather than a persona, a mindset

[empiric] [rationalist] [impressionable]
For this project, we found that persona's were not the best way to describe residents. When probed about their mask wearing behaviors or their considerations on when they could be exposed to hazardous air, they would react to the circumstance vs. follow the strict guidelines. Most participants when describing their decision making process, shift between one or more personas, compromising to meet social demands (e.g. friends visiting) or personal goals (hiking without a mask), despite describing themselves as health conscious.

## the solution: 3-part air quality system

### imagine this...

{/* <audio storyboards x 3> */}

Given the lack of knowledge around air quality, we chose to create a 3-part system instead of a single solution in order to increase chances of residents encountering information about air quality. It consists of the air quality station, texts alerts, and a website. We believe having multiple reminders about air quality will spark interest in being informed about air. Read more about this [here].

### Air station

### Texts and alerts

### Reimagining AQI tiers

[sample video]

> The design should be accessible, trustworthy, have calm but firm messaging, informative, and easily understandable.

We decided to focus on testing the Air Quality Station, since of the three, it was the most novel item. The design should communicate critical public health information to as many people as possible, and as many circumstances within the city. Therefore, it should be widespread (i.e. doesn't rely on internet connection) 2) support multiple modalities (touch, sight, etc), informative, and as easy to understand for the public to make the best decision for themselves at a glance.
The physical prototype went through three stages of iteration, with the last on the right our final version. We asked users to perform a set of 3 tasks, first guessing what the air station is for, second, understanding the visualization, and third, getting a mask from the air station.

### reworking the visualization of air quality

Many participants reported using at-a-glance judgement make decisions, and this compelled us to rework the current visualization of air quality. We reduced the number of levels and improved the color scheme based on our research and usability testing. The visualizations went through user testing, and are understandable regardless of whether or not you are color blind.
