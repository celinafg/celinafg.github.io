## The Challenge

Guiding Behavior Amid a Growing Health Crisis

> _“How can we empower Seattle residents to make healthier decisions when air quality is compromised?”_

In October 2022, Seattle's air quality plunged to an alarming **AQI of 168**, marking one of the worst pollution levels globally. With wildfire smoke increasingly impacting public health, many Seattle residents lacked accurate information or tools to protect themselves. The challenge was twofold:

1. **Inform:** Educate people about the health risks of poor air quality.
2. **Influence:** Guide safer behavior and empower decision-making during poor air conditions.

---

## **Our Process**

We adopted a multi-layered research approach, combining **secondary research**, **surveys**, and **interviews** to understand how air quality impacts behavior and decision-making.

### **1. Secondary Research**

To establish foundational knowledge, we explored existing studies and data on air quality and public health. Key takeaways:

- **Vulnerable groups**: Children, elderly, and outdoor workers face the highest risks.
- **Current strategies**: People rely on weather apps, masks, and staying indoors, though knowledge gaps remain.
- **Communication channels**: Social media, especially Facebook, is the most-used platform for smoke alerts.

### **2. Surveys**

We surveyed **17 Seattle residents** to gather quantitative insights into beliefs, behaviors, and knowledge around air quality. Findings included:

- **94%** relied on weather apps for air quality updates.
- Most adjusted outdoor plans when AQI exceeded **101-150** (unhealthy for sensitive groups).
- **75%** had someone in their household sensitive to poor air quality.

### **3. Semi-Structured Interviews**

Through **9 interviews**, we uncovered the nuanced motivations and behaviors behind air quality decision-making.

- People rarely followed strict rules; decisions were contextual (e.g., social events vs. personal health).
- Visual cues like **AQI color scales** and outdoor visibility often dictated behavior.

---

## **Key Insight: The Power of Perception and Trust**

Participants’ understanding of air quality risks was often **underestimated** or **misinformed**. Trust in information sources was critical, yet varied:

- Some relied on **official channels** like EPA reports.
- Others prioritized **community-driven cues**, such as friends’ behavior or local Facebook posts.

This led us to **pivot our design question**:

### **From:** _"How might we design safe outdoor gatherings during poor air quality?"_

### **To:** _"How might we inform people of the health effects of poor air quality and influence their behavior to mitigate exposure?"_

---

## **Design Principles**

From our research, we established six guiding principles to inform our solution:

1. **Accessible**: Provide critical information to everyone, regardless of internet access or physical abilities.
2. **Trustworthy**: Leverage reliable, unbiased data to build confidence in the system.
3. **Informative**: Educate users about air quality risks and their health implications.
4. **Timely**: Offer real-time, location-specific updates.
5. **Clear**: Avoid jargon; make the messaging easy to understand at a glance.
6. **Calming**: Present information in a way that avoids panic while encouraging action.

---

## **Our Solution: The Seattle Air Quality System**

We envisioned a **three-part system** designed to deliver timely, trustworthy, and actionable air quality information:

### **1. Air Quality Stations**

Physical kiosks placed in high-traffic areas like bus stops, parks, and downtown hubs.

- **Features**:
  - **Visual AQI displays**: Easy-to-read, color-coded indicators for air quality levels.
  - **Mask dispensers**: Free N95 masks available via a secure, SMS-based system.
  - **Audio instructions**: Accessibility features for visually impaired users.
- **Rationale**: Many people base decisions on visual cues. By integrating these stations into their daily routines, we reinforced awareness at key decision points.

### **2. SMS Alert System**

A text-based notification service delivering real-time air quality updates and personalized alerts.

- Users can customize thresholds (e.g., notifications for AQI >100).
- Emergency alerts sent automatically when AQI exceeds **150**.
- **Rationale**: Text messages ensure inclusivity, reaching people without smartphones or reliable internet access.

### **3. Educational Website**

A central hub for air quality resources, including:

- Health tips for mitigating exposure.
- Scientific explanations of AQI and its impacts.
- Tools to customize SMS alerts.
- **Rationale**: Deepened engagement by empowering users to learn more at their own pace.

---

## **Outcomes and Impact**

### **Prototyping and Testing**

- Built and tested **three iterations** of the Air Quality Station with users.
- Conducted usability tests for the SMS system and website with 6 participants.

### **Key Results**

1. **Increased Awareness**: Over 80% of users reported learning new health risks related to air quality.
2. **Behavior Change**: Testing participants said they were more likely to wear masks and adjust outdoor plans based on the system’s information.
3. **Positive Feedback**: Users appreciated the **clarity** of the AQI visualization and the **reliability** of the SMS notifications.

## **Reflection**

This project was a powerful reminder of how design can influence public health and behavior. By prioritizing accessibility, trust, and clarity, we crafted a system that didn’t just inform—it empowered.

As a researcher, I learned the importance of being adaptable, particularly when our findings led to a pivot in the design focus. Collaboration with a multidisciplinary team enriched the process, allowing us to address challenges from multiple angles.

---

### **Takeaways**

- **Iterate with Purpose**: Testing early and often helped us refine our designs to better align with user needs.
- **Adaptability is Key**: The pivot in our design question was a turning point, enabling us to address the root cause of behavior.
- **Empathy First**: Understanding the diverse needs and mindsets of our audience ensured that our solution was both inclusive and impactful.

This case study demonstrates my ability to lead user research, synthesize complex data, and translate insights into actionable, user-centered designs.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **Challenge:** Behavior Complexity

**Solution:** Developed fluid mindsets instead of fixed personas, acknowledging shifts in user behavior.

---

### **Challenge:** Balancing Accessibility with Cost\*\*

**Solution:** Introduced an OTP system for mask dispensing to prevent misuse while maintaining accessibility.

---

## **Impact and Reflection**

### **Impact**

- Provided equitable access to life-saving health information and masks.
- Sparked community engagement with AQI awareness.
- Influenced behavior changes that mitigate health risks.

### **Reflection**

This project emphasized the importance of empathy in UX research. Understanding the diverse mindsets and behaviors of Seattle residents informed an inclusive, human-centered design approach.

### **Takeaway**

When addressing public health challenges, solutions must blend education, accessibility, and adaptability to meet users where they are.
