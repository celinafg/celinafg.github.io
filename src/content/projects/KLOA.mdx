## **The Challenge: Improving Typing and Search Experiences**

> _“This could be useful, but the effort to adapt is just too much.”_

KLOA, a startup focused on enhancing mobile search efficiency, sought to refine its unique typing interface and contextual search algorithm. Targeting integration with shopping platforms like Instacart, KLOA's innovative approach required users to adapt to a new input method—a challenge in itself.

The key questions driving the usability study were:

1. How does priming participants affect their perception of KLOA?
2. What barriers and frustrations do participants face when using KLOA?
3. How willing are users to invest effort in learning this new interface?

---

## **Goals**

1. **Usability and Adaptability:** Ensure KLOA’s interface is intuitive and easy to learn.
2. **User Satisfaction:** Enhance the typing experience by addressing pain points.
3. **Business Viability:** Position KLOA as a valuable addition to shopping apps.

## **Research Approach**

### **Methodology**

- **Participants**: Five individuals recruited based on their recent mobile shopping habits.
- **Scenarios**: Users completed tasks on a prototype of KLOA integrated with Instacart, adding items like “Apples” and “Broccoli” to their carts.
- **Tools**: A printed one-pager for onboarding, think-aloud methods, and structured interviews.

### **Key Metrics**

- Task completion rates
- User Burden Scale (UBS)
- Qualitative feedback (observed behaviors and verbal responses)

---

## **Findings: What Worked and What Didn’t**

### **Key Insights (Positive Findings)**

1. **Quick and Relevant Suggestions**  
   Participants appreciated when search suggestions appeared after 1–2 taps.

   > _“I just typed ‘b,’ and broccoli showed up—it’s nice when it works this well.”_ – P3

2. **Willingness to Learn**  
   Despite frustrations, 4 out of 5 participants expressed some willingness to learn the interface.

3. **Perceived Innovation**  
   Some participants found the concept novel and intriguing, particularly within a tech-savvy audience.
   > _“I might share this with my coworkers—they’d find it interesting as a case study.”_ – P2

---

### **Pain Points and Barriers**

#### **Critical Issues (Severity: 3)**

- **Lack of Feedback While Typing**  
  Users felt lost without visual feedback on their input, leading to task abandonment.

  > _“I didn’t know if I was typing correctly. It felt like a guessing game.”_ – P4

- **Preference for QWERTY**  
  Most participants reverted to the default QWERTY keyboard after struggling with KLOA.
  > _“It’s frustrating—I’m used to typing quickly, and this slows me down.”_ – P5

#### **Moderate Issues (Severity: 2)**

- **Confusing Visual Layout**  
  The arrangement of keys, particularly the blue keys, confused participants.
  > _“I don’t get why two letters are on one key—it’s not intuitive.”_ – P1

#### **Minor Issues (Severity: 1)**

- **Ineffective Onboarding**  
  Participants struggled to remember instructions from the printed one-pager.
  > _“It seemed simple, but I forgot it immediately.”_ – P4

---

## **Opportunities for Improvement**

### **1. Onboarding Experience**

- Introduce interactive onboarding (e.g., video tutorials or in-app labels).
- Use progressive disclosure, providing tips over time instead of all at once.

### **2. Typing Feedback**

- Ensure typed letters are displayed in real-time to meet usability heuristics (e.g., system status visibility).

### **3. Visual Redesign**

- Experiment with a QWERTY-inspired layout to reduce cognitive load.
- Highlight frequently used keys with color or placement optimization.

### **4. Enhance Algorithm Performance**

- Focus on refining predictive accuracy to delight users with precise suggestions.

## **Results**

### **Task Completion**

| Task                  | Completion Rate (%) | Notes                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Add “Onions”          | 100%                | No major barriers observed.                   |
| Add “Apples”          | 80%                 | Some struggled with letter placement.         |
| Add “Broccoli”        | 60%                 | Repeated attempts due to interface confusion. |
| Add “Sparkling Water” | 40%                 | Many switched to QWERTY for this task.        |

### **User Burden Scale (Difficulty of Use)**

- Average score: **2.5 (Grade F)**
- **Key Observation**: Participants found the interface effort-intensive to learn and use effectively.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Iterate on Interface Design**
   - Test a QWERTY-style layout and provide real-time feedback on typing.
2. **Enhance Onboarding**
   - Incorporate step-by-step guidance with interactive elements.
3. **Refine Study Methods**
   - Conduct A/B testing with diverse participant pools to validate changes.

## **Final Reflections: Balancing Innovation with Usability**

While KLOA’s innovative approach shows promise, this study revealed critical usability gaps. By addressing feedback visibility, simplifying the layout, and refining onboarding, KLOA can bridge the gap between novelty and functionality. The key takeaway? **Innovation is only impactful when users can easily engage with it.**
