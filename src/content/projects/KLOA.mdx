In today's mobile-first world, efficient typing on smartphones remains a persistent challenge. KLOA, a startup focused on improving mobile search efficiency, developed a novel typing interface designed to integrate with shopping platforms like Instacart. While innovative, KLOA's approach required users to adapt to a new input method‚Äîa significant challenge as we discovered through usability testing. Users expressed frustration with the transition: _"This could be useful, but the effort to adapt is just too much."_

The project prompted us to explore the balance between innovation and usability in mobile search. Our research led us to focus on the question: "How might we create a typing interface that enhances search efficiency while minimizing the learning curve for users?" Our final deliverable is a set of recommendations for improving KLOA's typing experience across three key areas: onboarding, visual feedback, and interface design.

### How does the interface work?

![image describing how kloa works from our one pager](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1740567013/portfolio/iPad_mini_8.3_-_1_upcdeq.png)

1. Novel layout
2. Contextual search algorithm

## Research Questions

Given the dominance of QWERTY keyboards, we wanted to know:

1. How does priming users affect their perception of KLOA‚Äôs typing interface?
2. What usability barriers make learning the system difficult?
3. To what extent are users willing to invest effort in adopting a new typing method?

We conducted usability tests with five participants selected based on their recent mobile shopping habits, asking them to complete tasks like adding "Apples" and "Broccoli" to their carts using KLOA integrated with Instacart.

### What worked well

‚úÖ **Quick and relevant suggestions are highly valued when they work well.**

- Participants appreciated when search suggestions appeared after just 1-2 taps.
  > _I just typed ‚Äòb,‚Äô and broccoli showed up‚Äîit‚Äôs nice when it works this well._ ‚Äì P3

‚úÖ **Some users saw potential in the concept**

- Despite initial frustration, 4 out of 5 participants expressed curiosity about KLOA‚Äôs unique approach.
  > _I might share this with my coworkers‚Äîthey‚Äôd find it interesting as a case study._ ‚Äì P2

### What was a challenge

**‚ùóUsers expect immediate feedback while typing and become disoriented without it.**

- Most participants reported frustration when they couldn't see what they were typing.The lack of visual feedback was a major barrier to adoption.
- _I didn‚Äôt know if I was typing correctly. It felt like a guessing game._ ‚Äì P4

**‚ùóStrong preference for familiar QWERTY layouts creates resistance to change.**

- Most participants defaulted back to a traditional keyboard after initial struggles.
- _It‚Äôs frustrating‚ÄîI‚Äôm used to typing quickly, and this slows me down._ ‚Äì P5

**‚ùóConfusing visual layout of keys creates uncertainty during use.**

- The design of multi-letter keys led to uncertainty in input accuracy. Participants struggled to understand the organizational logic of the keyboard arrangement.
- _I don‚Äôt get why two letters are on one key‚Äîit‚Äôs not intuitive._ ‚Äì P1

**‚ùó Onboarding information was difficult to retain during actual usage.**

- Participants forgot the instructions from the printed one-pager soon after reading.
- _It seemed simple, but I forgot it immediately._ ‚Äì P4

## Opportunities for improvement

### **1. Improve and explore onboarding methods**

- Introduce interactive onboarding elements such as in-app tooltips and progressive disclosure.
- Test the effectiveness of short video tutorials for explaining key interactions.

### **2. Provide Real-Time Feedback**

- Display typed letters dynamically to give users confirmation of input.
- Use subtle animations or haptics to reinforce action feedback.

### **3. Refine the Keyboard Layout**

- Explore a QWERTY-inspired version to lower cognitive load.

### **4. Optimize Search Algorithm**

- Fine-tune predictive accuracy to ensure consistently relevant suggestions.
- Reduce the number of interactions required to select a desired search result.

## Results

| Task                  | Completion Rate (%) | Notes                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Add ‚ÄúOnions‚Äù          | 100%                | No major barriers observed.                   |
| Add ‚ÄúApples‚Äù          | 80%                 | Some struggled with letter placement.         |
| Add ‚ÄúBroccoli‚Äù        | 60%                 | Repeated attempts due to interface confusion. |
| Add ‚ÄúSparkling Water‚Äù | 40%                 | Many switched to QWERTY for this task.        |

**User Burden Scale:** **2.5 (Grade F)**

üîπ Users found KLOA effort-intensive to learn and apply effectively.

## Reflection

1. Working with a constantly changing product proved to be difficult to test given the quick pace of development.
2. Working with a prototype that was unfinished was difficult, leading to challenges in assessing real-world usability.
3. Learned a lot about stakeholder management, balancing user needs with business and technical constraints.
