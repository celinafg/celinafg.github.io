## Overview

The Edmonds Historical Museum (EHM) faced significant challenges: declining visitor numbers, limited volunteer engagement, and an urgent need for modernization. Our team developed an iterative approach to transform EHM from a passive exhibit space into an interactive, engaging destination that would appeal to families and revitalize the museum's community presence.

Located in Edmonds, WA (population 42,000), EHM struggled with:

- Static exhibits failing to engage modern visitors
- Limited operational budget and resources
- Low community awareness despite central location
- Insufficient volunteer participation despite strong community volunteerism

## Research Insights

### How did we get there?

We gathered insights from **118 participants** through 3 primary research methods:

| Research Method  | Participants | Key Purpose                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surveys**      | 95           | Assess community awareness and visitor satisfaction                  |
| **Observations** | 10           | Understand visitor behavior patterns within the museum               |
| **Interviews**   | 13           | Gather in-depth perspectives from stakeholders and community members |

### 1. Exhibit Functionality Impacts Experience

Poor lighting, hard-to-read labels, and limited accessibility negatively influenced visitor perception and created barriers to engagement.

> – Community member

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### 2. Visitors Seek Interactive Experiences

Modern visitors wanted exhibits that offered deeper connections through interaction, diverse narratives, and creative displays.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### 3. Volunteer Engagement Gap

Despite high community volunteerism in Edmonds, the museum struggled to attract and retain volunteers, highlighting an opportunity to enhance operations.

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

### 4. Awareness ≠ recommendation

While 95% of surveyed community members were aware of the museum, only 1 out of 31 explicitly mentioned it as a recommended destination when asked about local attractions.

> I know it’s there but never really thought to visit. – Edmonds resident

### 5. Visitor Motivations Matter More Than Demographics

Following John Falk's museum visitorship research, we identified five key visitor archetypes based on motivations rather than demographics:

## Solution

We developed a "Kids' Gallery" as a dynamic test bed, implementing 19 interactive initiatives over a 7-week period:

    },
  ]}
  width="auto"
  height="400px"
  autoplay={false}
  interval={4000}
/>

1. **Interactive Elements**: Photo booth, train play station, coloring activities, and scavenger hunts

2. **Community Engagement**: Mascot naming contest with visitor-submitted names

3. **Operational Improvements**: Extended hours, opened previously closed upper-level doors

4. **Visibility Enhancements**: Updated signage, promotional posters, and sidewalk chalk art

Our approach embraced four core design principles:

  <Column>
    - **Easy implementation**: Low-barrier activities that could be quickly
    deployed
  </Column>
  <Column>
    - **Low technology**: Budget-friendly solutions avoiding expensive tech

    - **Encouraging interactions**: Activities fostering longer, more meaningful
    visits
  </Column>
  <Column>
    - **Increasing awareness**: Strategic marketing to improve community

## Results

Our initiatives dramatically transformed the museum's performance:

## Process & Implementation

![2 Phases and 19 Initiatives schedule showing the project timeline and implementation](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1740668904/portfolio/8_Final_Solution_1_f7fi2s.png)

We followed a two-phase approach based on the UK Design Council's design process:

**Phase 1: Planning & Benchmarking (Winter)**

- Defined KPIs to track visitor numbers, donations, and satisfaction
- Researched successful interactive museum exhibits
- Analyzed museum space utilization

**Phase 2: Execution & Testing (Spring)**

- Built and deployed the Kids' Gallery test bed
- Used iterative design to constantly improve experiences
- Collected feedback through observation and surveys
- Made weekly adjustments based on visitor responses

## Key Learnings

Working with a historical museum under real-world constraints provided valuable insights:

**Stakeholder Alignment**  
Conflicting priorities between the museum board and staff required careful navigation. Clear communication and collaborative approaches helped align different visions.

**Resource Constraints**  
Limited time and budget forced us to prioritize high-impact, low-cost initiatives. This constraint drove creativity and practical solutions.

**Community-Centric Design**  
Direct engagement with the community was essential for understanding their needs and preferences, resulting in more meaningful experiences.

**Operational Impact**  
Simple changes like keeping doors visibly open had dramatic effects. Many visitors mentioned they'd "never seen the museum open before."

## Future Recommendations

![Lifecycle for Success slide showing the four-part lifecycle model for sustainability](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1740669905/portfolio/15_Moving_Forward_jxsnro.png)

For EHM's long-term success, we recommended:

1. **Permanent Kids' Gallery**: Maintain the successful interactive space
2. **Enhanced Volunteer Programs**: Strengthen community outreach and volunteer recognition
3. **Innovative Exhibit Design**: Collaborate with design students for fresh approaches
4. **Comprehensive Marketing**: Expand social media and maintain consistent community engagement

## Conclusion

Our project demonstrated that EHM could be transformed from a static repository of artifacts into a vibrant community hub. By strategically focusing on visitor motivations, interactive elements, and operational improvements, we created a sustainable approach that dramatically increased visitor numbers and donations, proving that small museums can thrive with the right engagement strategy.
