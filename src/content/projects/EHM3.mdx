summary: |
  The local Edmonds Historical Museum serves a community is Edmonds, Washington of 42,000. Housed in a former Carnegie Library and established in 1914, it preserves local history through exhibits and programs. Their permanent exhibit has not changed since the 90s, and what was once a well-attended museum faces problems maintaining relevance. Visitor numbers have been declining, especially in the wake of more interactive exhibits newer museums have adapted. How does EHM improve visitor experience and engage the community to increase the number of new visitors?

  As the UX Designer and prototyper, I led the overall design of the physical space. We were give the entire first floor of the museum where temporary exhibits were usually held. I led the design of our iterations through our 19 initiatives, transforming our research insights and designs into reality.

  Our teams work significantly revived the museum's community presence and operational sustainability. We saw a 19x increase in visitors*, 41x increase in donations*, and 300+ visitor interactions through the 19 initiatives we designed, tested, and deployed. We established sustainable operational improvements, and created low-cost, high impact engagement framework that the museum can continue to benefit from even when our project was over. Some of our initiatives are still currently being implemented at the museum.

## Context

#### A decline in visitorship threatens the future of the museum.

The EHM is faced with significant challenges: a large decline in visitor
numbers, a lack of volunteers, and a much needed exhibit refresh to modernize
and carry the museum into the next 10, 20 years.

## Research

##### Discovery

- Who visits museums?
- What current factors contribute to visitor experience?
- Do people know about the museum?
- What do visitors hope to see?
- What role do volunteers play?

<Spacer size="small" />

##### Mixed Methods

- **Community surveys (95 participants)**  
  Assess community awareness and visitor satisfactions

- **Field Research (10 participants)**  
  through direct observations (fly on the wall) and contextual inquiry:
  understand visitor behavior patterns within the museum

- **Interviews (13 participants)**  
  gather in-depth perspectives from stakeholders and community members

- **Desk Research** helped frame our theoretical approach, understand target
  populations and benchmark best practices in museum sector

## Insights

### 1. Limited functionality hurts experience

    King, Smith, Wilson and Williams work note that museum functionality refers to how content is presented in the space and how the audience access it. This includes practical working of exhibit elements, intellectual and physical accessibility, and being able to navigate through the space.

_Practical working of exhibition elements_

Based on our observations, poor lighting, hard to-read exhibit labels (font
size, placement, etc) negatively affect the exhibit experience due to user
frustration.

<Spacer size="small" />

_Intellectual and physical accessibility_

Closed doors and the absence of signage deters visitors from entering. The
museum entrance is almost hidden at the lower entrance, and no sign indicates
whether the museum is opened or closed. We did not observe accommodations made
for other forms of disabilities.

<Spacer size="small" />

_Museum operations_

The museum operations lack consistency, dependability and quality, from the
building infrastructure to information online about operational hours and
service quality. Observations unveiled infrastructure issues like non functional
bathrooms, noise, poor lighting, and heat detract from the visitor experience.

<Spacer size="small" />

### 2. Lack of volunteers impact operations affects visitor numbers and day to day work.

    Volunteer contributions range from administrative tasks to visitor services, which are essential for the museum's functionality. They serve as ambassadors of the museum within the community, helping raise awareness, foster community relations, and encourage participation and support from the public. Their role cannot be overstated enough because they are largely responsible for keeping the museum open.

    <Spacer size="xsmall" />


    The local Edmonds community experiences an overall high rate of volunteerism, but the EHM in particular cannot seem to get enough volunteers. This highlights an opportunity to attract and retain volunteers, which will enhance operations.

    <Spacer size="small" />

### 3. Awareness != recommendation: high awareness doesn't translate to visits.

    Research revealed a stark disconnect: while 95% of surveyed residents knew about the museum and 72% had visited, only 1 in 31 spontaneously recommended it as a destination.

    Interestingly, intercept interviews contradicted survey findings. Residents reported not having heard of the museum despite living there. Contextual inquiry revealed that for some visitors, the decision to visit the museum was not premeditated, and were often serendipitous, occurring while individuals noticed or passed by the museum.

    <Spacer size="small" />

### 4. Visitors seek interactive experiences

    Survey respondents express a wish to see stories "come to life", indicating a preference for exhibits that are not only informativve but also engaging and immersive. Younger audiences strongly desire interaction with physical displays.

    Social interactions at the museum were spotlighted through various research methods. We observe that social interactions among visitors, whether between family members of volunteers, tend to extend the duration of visits, and enrich the overall experience. Our open ended survey responses show that participants value the opportunity to share the experience with friends and family, suggesting that the museum could serve as a space for community and connection.

    <Spacer size="small" />

### 5. Visitors are best described by their drivers and motivations instead of demographic based personas.

    Based on the research of John Falk on museums and visitorship, demographics is not the best indicator to describe museum experience. He developed five archetypes, detailing behaviors in the museum are based on drivers and motivations that visitors may switch between. We confirmed this through our field research, using direct observation.

## Design

Based on interviews with stakeholders and our research, we decided that the
design should be:

<TextRow gap="3" columns={2} padding="2rem">
  <Column >
    <Icon name="solar:plug-circle-linear" class="mb-4" size={"20px"}  />

    ##### Easy to implement
    To facilitate rapid prototyping, we incorporated activities that were straightforward to implement and easy to adopt

  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Icon name="solar:ruler-pen-linear" class="mb-4" size={"20px"} is:inline={true} />

    ##### Low technology
      Given the museum's infrastructure and limited budget, we needed to consider design solutions that would be implementable even after our capstone ended.

  </Column>
  <Column>
    <Icon name="solar:hand-money-linear" size={"20px"} class="mb-4" is:inline={true}  />

    ##### Encourage interactions

      These lay the foundation for increased repeat visits, higher donations, volunteerism, ultimately supporting the museum's long-term success

    <Icon name="solar:chat-round-like-broken" class='mb-4' size={"20px"} is:inline={true} />

    ##### Increase awareness
      We focused on creating initiatives that heighten awareness, word of mouth referrals and providied lasting reminders after visitors left.

## Iterations

###### We tried to cover as much ground for 7 weeks

The Kids' Gallery was a 7-week dynamic test bed that employed an iterative
process to test and refine our initiatives weekly. Coupled with marketing
activities, this resulted in a targeted strategy for EHM. We wanted to try as
many initiatives as possible in order to get a rough sense of what the local
community responded to, that the museum could use as a basis for future
exhibits.

<Spacer size="medium" />

###### Unsuccessful initiatives were sunsetted, and feedback allowed us to create new ones.

As we progressed through the weeks, we continued to collect data on the
performance of each initiative. Some initiatives did not make it - story time
was put to an end, among others. We also were able to get constructive feedback
of our early prototype - that is was only for young children. This led us to
come up with a new initiative that was largely successful across ages (yes,
adults too).

The Scavenger Hunt was an initiative we created to engage adults
and older children. In the Edmonds museum, the basement floor housed their
permanent exhibit that was put up in the 90s. We were allowed to place small
beaver figurines (the unofficial mascot of Edmonds, known for their beaver
community) around the permanent exhibits, that allowed visitors to engage and
really look at the dioramas instead of just breezing past them. We saw
engagement not only with the dioramas, but also among visitors in their groups.

## Results

Our initiatives dramatically transformed the musem's performance:

![sdf](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1740748009/portfolio/ehm/9_Outcome_3_iapzyx.png)

Additionally, we achieved 19x increase in visitors compared to may 2018, 41x
increase in donations (compared to May 2018) 300+ interactions through
initiatives.

## Lifecycle for success

![lifecycle for success](https://res.cloudinary.com/digifab/image/upload/v1740669905/portfolio/ehm/15_Moving_Forward_jxsnro.png)

For EHM's long-term success, we recommend:

1. Interactive gallery space: maintain the kids gallery
2. Enhanced volunteer programs: strengthen community outreach and volunteer
   recognition
3. Innovate Exhibit Design: collaborate with design students for fresh
   approaches

Our project has shown that EHM is more than just a repository of historical
artifacts; it is a vibrant and valuable community resource capable of evolving
to meet contemporary needs. By strategically planning for long-term
sustainability and continuously improving visitor engagement, EHM can remain a
central hub for cultural enrichment and community engagement in Edmonds.

## Reflection

Working with a historical museum under real-world constraints provided valuable insights:

<Spacer size="xsmall" />

**Stakeholder Alignment**  
Conflicting priorities between the museum board and staff required careful navigation. Clear communication and collaborative approaches helped align different visions.

**Resource Constraints**  
Limited time and budget forced us to prioritize high-impact, low-cost initiatives. This constraint drove creativity and practical solutions.

**Community-Centric Design**  
Direct engagement with the community was essential for understanding their needs and preferences, resulting in more meaningful experiences.

**Operational Impact**  
Simple changes like keeping doors visibly open had dramatic effects. Many visitors mentioned they'd "never seen the museum open before."
