## The Challenge: Transforming a Museum’s Role in the Community

> _“Despite living here for years, I didn’t even know the museum existed.”_

The Edmonds Historical Museum (EHM) faces dwindling visitor numbers, limited engagement, and an outdated reputation. A large decline in visitor numbers, a lack of volunteers and a much needed refresh to carry them forward into the next 10-20 years.

- Limited functionality hurts experience: improve exhibits and operations for happier visitors
- Lack of volunteers impacting operations: affects visitor numbers and day to day work
- Awareness is not recommendation. High awareness doesn't translate to visits
- Visitors crave interactive exhibits and diverse stories

_How does EHM improve visitor experience and engage the community to increase the number of new visitors?_

We constructed the kids gallery as a dynamic test bed, employing iterative process to test and refine our initiatives on a weekly basis, with targeted marketing efforts.

**Impact:**
19 initiatives tested and deployed
19x increase in visitors (compared to May 2018)
41x increase in donations (compared to may 2018)
300+ interactions through initiatives

Transforming EHM from a traditionall, passive experience into a dynamic, interactive space that resonates and educates with visitors of all generations.

Challenges:

- Visitor Engagement: Modern visitors seek interactive experiences compared to the current static exhibits at the museum
- Operational flexibility and financial stability: Limited budget and resources restrict the museums ability to innovate, enhance and implement new programs that impact long term stability
- Community Awareness: while the community is aware of EHM, it is not a top of mind destination.
- volunteer engagement: the strong local volunteer culture does not translate into support for the ehm.

### Project Goals

1. **Increase Visitor Numbers:** Attracting more visitors is crucial to the sustainability of the museum
2. **Deepen Community Engagement:** Strengthen ties with the local community. To cater to diverse audiences, including families and children
3. **Achieve Financial Stability:** Increase donations and repeat visits ensuring the museums long-term viability

## Research: Listening to the Community

We had four primary research methods:

[THIS SHOULD BE A EXPANDING BLOCK]
**Desk research**
Helped frame our theoretical approach, understand our target populations in context and benchmark against best practices in the museum sector
**Field research**
Through direct observations and contextual inquiry, we validated desk research findings and were privy to crucial elements in the visitor experience that were not highlighted to use by stakeholders.
**Interviews**
Interviewed stakeholders, community members, volunteers and museum experts
**Surveys**
Utilized 2 surveys with a total of 90 particiapntsto gain comprehensive view of the museums standing in Edmonds community and visitor engagement, informing strategies for improvement and growth

### Key Findings

1. **Drivers and Motivators:** Museum visitors are best described by their drivers and motivations instead of demographic-based personas
2. **Operational and Functional Challenges:** Limited exhibit functionality and operational challenges negatively affect visitor perception and act as significant barriers to a positive museum experience
3. **Visitors want interactive exhibits:** EHM visitors seek interactive experience, diverse narratives and creative displays (highlighting changing preferences for engagement, inclusivity and dialogue int he face of evolving technology)
4. **Volunteer gap:** The gap between Edmonds' high community volunteerism and the low museum volunteer engagement highlights an opportunity to attract and retain volunteers, enhancing operations

These insights shaped our focus on **interactive design, visibility improvements, and volunteer engagement**.

## Design Principles: Small Changes, Big Impact

We focused on explorers and facilitator archetypes while targeting families with kids to increase the number of visitors to the museum.

1. Easy to implement (to facilitate for rapid prototyping)
2. Low Technology (to account for museums infrastructure and limited budget)
3. Encourage interaction (interactive displays to engage visitors and lead to higher donations)
4. Increase awareness and exposure to EHM (strategic marketing initiatives highlighting awareness and encouraged word of mouth referrals)
