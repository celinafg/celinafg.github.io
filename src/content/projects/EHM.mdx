In Edmonds, a picturesque coastal town with 42,000 residents, the Historical Museum (EHM) faced a critical challenge: dwindling visitor numbers, limited engagement, and an outdated reputation. As one community member noted, _"Despite living here for years, I didn't even know the museum existed."_ This disconnect between awareness and visitation threatened the museum's long-term sustainability and its role as a community hub.

The project prompted our team to explore how a small historical museum could reconnect with its community through accessible, low-tech solutions. Our research led us to focus on the question: "How might we improve visitor experience and engage the community to increase the number of new visitors?" Our final deliverable was a series of 19 initiatives tested and deployed in the museum, with particular focus on transforming the Kids Gallery into a dynamic, interactive space.

## Research

- Desk research to frame theoretical approaches and understand target populations
- Field research through direct observations and contextual inquiry
- Stakeholder and community interviews
- Community surveys (75 respondents) and museum experience surveys (20 respondents)

### What makes museums struggle in modern communities?

> "I didn't know this museum was here!"

We chose to focus on museum engagement because cultural institutions increasingly struggle to compete for attention in our digital era. Through comprehensive research, we explored how small museums can remain relevant despite limited resources. The Edmonds Historical Museum was previously a Carnegie Library, located in the heart of town, but facing significant operational challenges.

What made this challenge unique was the disconnect between community awareness and actual visitation. While many locals knew of the museum's existence, few considered it a destination worth visiting, revealing a deeper issue with perceived value and engagement.

### Who does this affect anyway?

Everyone in the Edmonds community!

The most affected groups include families seeking educational experiences, history enthusiasts, schools, and the volunteer community. However, the museum's role as a keeper of local heritage makes its vitality important to all residents who benefit from a connected, culturally rich community.

### What do community members want from their local museum?

Given the museum's struggle with engagement, we wanted to know:

1. What drives people to visit museums, and what keeps them away?
2. How do visitors prefer to engage with historical content?
3. What operational challenges impact the visitor experience?

We conducted extensive research to understand visitor motivations and barriers to engagement. Our findings shaped a strategy focused on interactive experiences, improved accessibility, and community connection.

## Findings

### Limited functionality hurts visitor experience.

Based on our research, operational and physical issues created significant barriers to positive experiences. Poor lighting, hard-to-read exhibit labels, and confusing navigation negatively affected visitor perception.

> _"I tried to visit twice before, but it was always closed."_ – Community member

### Lack of volunteers impacting operations.

Despite Edmonds' strong volunteer culture, the museum struggled to maintain adequate volunteer staffing, directly affecting visitor numbers and day-to-day operations.

> _"Having at least 3 volunteers allows for more flexibility and longer hours."_ – Observation from testing

### Awareness ≠ recommendation.

While 95% of surveyed community members were aware of the museum, only 1 out of 31 explicitly mentioned it as a recommended destination when asked about local attractions.

> _"I know it's there but never really thought to visit."_ – Edmonds resident

### Visitors crave interactive exhibits and diverse stories.

Our survey respondents expressed a wish to see stories "come to life," indicating a preference for exhibits that are engaging and immersive rather than static displays.

> _"My kids get bored with just looking at things behind glass."_ – Parent visitor

## The solution: A dynamic test bed with weekly initiatives

### Design principles

Our approach emphasized practical, impactful changes guided by four key principles:

1. Easy to implement (facilitating rapid prototyping)
2. Low technology (accounting for limited infrastructure and budget)
3. Encouraging interaction (engaging visitors and potentially increasing donations)
4. Increasing awareness and exposure (strategic marketing initiatives)

### Week-by-week iterative testing

We transformed the Kids Gallery into a test bed for initiatives, implementing and refining ideas weekly based on visitor response:

### Week 1: Opening Up

We extended hours and opened upper-level doors with new signage: "Free Admission, Donations Appreciated."

> _"I didn't know this museum was here!"_ – First-time visitor

### Week 3: Activating Play with Kids' Gallery Prototypes

We launched the Kids' Gallery with play stations and coloring sheets, observing which elements engaged children most effectively. We noticed that while the train set was popular, the story corner had little traction despite marketing.

> _"Finally, a museum where my kids can touch things!"_ – Parent visitor

### Week 5: Driving Participation

We introduced scavenger hunts and mascot voting to encourage active engagement throughout the museum.

> _"I won, I won!"_ – Child completing scavenger hunt

### Week 7: Scaling Visibility

We added sidewalk chalk art and face painting during the local market to increase visibility and draw in passersby. Many people mentioned they had never seen the museum open before.

> Attendance peaked at 208 visitors, with many walk-ins driven by visible, playful signage.

> The most effective museum experiences balance historical preservation with interactive engagement, making heritage accessible to all ages.

### Results

Our iterative approach delivered impressive outcomes:

- 19× increase in visitors (compared to May 2018)
- 41× increase in donations (compared to May 2018)
- 300+ interactions through new initiatives
- 19 initiatives tested and deployed

### Key achievements

1. **Visitor Engagement**
   Interactive additions like the Kids' Gallery, scavenger hunts, and photo booth significantly increased visitor interaction and time spent at the museum.

2. **Community Awareness**
   Updated signage, strategic posters, and social media campaigns raised awareness, positioning the museum as a recommended destination.

3. **Volunteer Engagement**
   A welcoming environment attracted more volunteers, extending operating hours and improving the visitor experience.

4. **Financial Stability**
   Cost-effective initiatives led to higher visitor numbers and a substantial increase in daily donations, providing a foundation for sustainability. With initiatives costing about $49/day while receiving $142.50/day, our team demonstrated that EHM can be profitable with sufficient resources.

The key takeaway? **Small, thoughtful changes can transform a struggling cultural institution into a vibrant community hub when designed with visitor motivations in mind.**
