# Understanding Flexbox in CSS

Flexbox is a powerful layout tool in CSS that allows you to create flexible and responsive designs with ease.

## Key Concepts

1. **Flex Container**: The parent element that uses `display: flex`.
2. **Flex Items**: The child elements inside the container.

### Example

```html
<div class="flex-container">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```
